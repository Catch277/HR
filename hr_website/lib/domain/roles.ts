 * Three levels, narrowest last:
 *
 * - `OWNER`   — owns the organization: its settings, its join code, its accounts and its branches.
 * - `MANAGER` — runs the day-to-day operation: shifts, timesheet review, requests, revenue.
 * - `EMPLOYEE`— sees and does only their own things (own shifts, own timesheet, own requests).
 *
 * `CHU` is the pre-SCRUM-59 spelling of `MANAGER`. `normalizeRole` still reads it so the app works
 * whether or not `SCRUM-59_role_model.sql` has been applied to the database yet, which keeps the
 * rename a single-step change instead of a coordinated deploy.
 *
 * This file is framework-free on purpose: the route handlers, the use cases, `proxy.ts` and the
 * client shell all read the same three strings from here, so a policy can never be written against
 * a role name the rest of the app does not know.
