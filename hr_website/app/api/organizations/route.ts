 *     description: |
 *       SCRUM-51: creates the organization of the signed-in account and makes the caller its OWNER.
 *       Registering no longer grants any role — ownership comes from creating an organization here.
 *       The organization receives the join code that colleagues spend (together with an invite on
 *       file) to join it.
